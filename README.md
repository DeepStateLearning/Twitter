# Twitter
I'm uisng this to test and demonstrate some attempt to put metrics on sets of twitter accounts, and also to try out some clustering techniques. 
In the first example, we start with a set of political accounts obtained from Steve Kramer:  https://data.world/drstevekramer/twitter-bot-detection-for-walkaway-campaign, and demonstrate that our a Ricci clustering based only on which retweets the user retweeted splits the group quite nicely. 
For the first example, see the page "Example1.md". 

I next took the users who had used the hashtag #FreeMariaButina.   The picture "maria.png" is very boring and random.  No obvious information, without comparing these to other groups. 

We use things like Ricci curvature and Wasserstein distance as part of our larger aim of "putting a geometry" on Twitter.
